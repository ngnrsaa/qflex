# qFlex: A flexible high-performance simulator for the verification and benchmarking of quantum circuits implemented on real hardware

## Description

Flexible Quantum Circuit Simulator (qFlex) implements an efficient tensor
network, CPU-based simulator of large quantum circuits. qFlex computes exact
probability amplitudes, a task that proves essential for the verification of
quantum hardware, as well as mimics quantum machines by computing amplitudes
with low fidelity. qFlex targets quantum circuits in the range of sizes expected
for supremacy experiments based on random quantum circuits, in order to verify
and benchmark such experiments.

## Documentation

qFlex scientific documentation and results can be found in
[[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09599) and
[[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00444). For technical documentation on how to
use qFlex, see [qflex/docs](/docs).

## Installation

To install qFlex on your machine, simply run:

```
$ autoreconf -i && autoconf && ./configure
$ make && make run-tests && make install
```

To disable tests based on `cirq`, use `./configure --disable-cirq_tests`
instead. By default, qFlex is installed in `$HOME/local/`. To change the
installation folder, use `./configure --prefix=/new/installation/folder/`. 

qFlex provides an experimental support for `OpenMP`. To activate `OpenMP`, run
`./configure` with the extra-option `--enable-openmp`.

For more information, see [the installation guide](/docs/install.md).

## Build Using Docker

[Docker](https://docker.com) allows you to run qFlex in an isolated environment,
without having to worry about managing dependencies.

To build qFlex with Docker, see [the Docker guide](/docs/docker.md).

## Build Using Rootless Containers

Rootless containers are an alternative to Docker targeted at users who may not
have `root` privileges on their machine.

To run qFlex in a rootless container, see
[qflex/docs/rootless-container.md](/docs/rootless-container.md).

## Using Google Cirq

[Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq) is a framework for modeling and
invoking Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits.

To run qFlex on Google Cirq circuits, or just to call the simulator from Python,
see [qflex/docs/cirq_interface.md](/docs/cirq_interface.md).
