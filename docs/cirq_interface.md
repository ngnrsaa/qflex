# The Cirq Python interface


Google Cirq can be used with QFlex. The currently supported version is 
Cirq 0.5.0 and new stable versions will be supported, once they are available.

Prerequisites are:
- Cirq 0.5.0
- QFlex

This file is an example of how to use the QFlex Python interface with Cirq.

A simulator and a device are necessary:

* The Device is a virtual device, that essentially makes sure that circuit gates
are decomposed (TODO) to supported gate types (for the moment,
 a restricted gate set)

* The Simulator calls the Python pybind11-based interface and checks that the
circuit to simulate was compiled (validated) against the device.

## Setting up

1. Compile QFlex with Pybind support and in the `./python` folder a shared library 
will be available as module to Python

2. If Cirq is not installed globally on the machine, create a virtual environment
and install Cirq by calling `./scripts/construct_cirq_environment.sh`

3. Run the example (Note: set PYTHONPATH before)

`export PYTHONPATH=. && python python/qflex_cirq_example.py`
