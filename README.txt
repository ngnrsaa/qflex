Flexible Quantum Circuit Simulator (qFlex) implements an efficient tensor
network, CPU-based simulator of large quantum circuits. qFlex computes exact
probability amplitudes, a task that proves essential for the verification of
quantum hardware, as well as mimics quantum machines by computing amplitudes
with low fidelity.  qFlex targets quantum circuits in the range of sizes
expected for supremacy experiments based on random quantum circuits, in order to
verify and benchmark such experiments.
